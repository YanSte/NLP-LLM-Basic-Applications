# <b><span style='color:#78D118'>|</span> Overview</b>

This notebook provides a whirlwind tour of various applications using Large Language Models (LLMs) from Hugging Face. The notebook covers the following applications:

- Summarization
- Sentiment analysis
- Translation
- Zero-shot classification
- Few-shot learning

The examples demonstrate how to leverage existing open-source and proprietary models available on [Hugging Face models](https://huggingface.co/models) for various applications. The notebook also introduces simple prompt engineering techniques.

Additionally, it explores Hugging Face APIs in more detail, providing insights into configuring LLM pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

1. Use a variety of existing models for common applications.
2. Understand basic prompt engineering.
3. Differentiate between search and sampling for LLM inference.
4. Familiarize yourself with key Hugging Face abstractions: datasets, pipelines, tokenizers, and models.
